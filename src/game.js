    - display something on every click in the canvas
    - display that something on the position of the mouse
    - use a defense tower sprite as that something that gets displayed
    - draw a circle with hardcoded radius around that sprite
    - detect when the mouse is inside the circle and log something
    - log only at most once every 2s
    - instead of logging draw a rocket sprite on the position of the defense tower
    - move that sprite a bit on every tick towards to the location where the mouse was detected
    - turn the sprite so that the rotation matches the way it is moving
    - when the target location is reached remove rocket sprite and replace with static explosion sprite
    - remove static explosion sprite after 1s
    - use the current location of the mouse as target of the rocket
    - use last known position inside the circle of the mouse when it is outside for the target of the rocket
    - play a sound when the rocket is flying
    - play a sound on impact
